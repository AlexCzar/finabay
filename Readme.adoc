== Simple application as per requirements specified in ElÄ«na's email
This is a Spring Boot application, build is setup using Gradle. To run the applicaiton, execute:
`./gradlew bootRun`, to test `./gradlew test` or, if on Windows based machine:
`gradlew.bat bootRun` and `gradlew.bat test` respectively.

=== Disclaimer. This is a small app for capability illustration purposses many aspects of a production
application are omited, e.g. unit-tests do not fully cover the app and all use cases, there is no security
(authentication, authorization), no i18n, etc. In case you'd like me to implement some of these, please
feel free to send additional requirements.
